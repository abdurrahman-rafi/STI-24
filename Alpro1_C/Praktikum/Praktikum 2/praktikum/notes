Pisang matang:

scanf("%*[^\n]");

% marks the beginning of a format specifier
* is the "assignment suppression" character - it tells scanf to read the input but not assign it to any variable (effectively discarding it)
[^\n] is a scanset that matches any character EXCEPT (^ means "not") the newline character \n
So this entire statement reads "scan and discard all characters until you reach a newline"

scanf("%*c");

% again marks the format specifier
* again means "read but don't assign to a variable"
c means "character"
So this reads and discards a single character (in this case, the newline character)
